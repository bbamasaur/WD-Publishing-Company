        <h2>And Yet, You Are So Sweet is a romantic comedy about a high school girl who pretends to have a crush on the school's heartthrob after being rejected by her own crush. Maaya Kisaragi is a 16-year-old high schooler who is rejected by her crush and vows to never confess again. However, the popular Chigira-kun overhears her and offers a solution to her heartbreak: she should pretend to have a crush on him. There are two conditions: Maaya can't fall in love with Chigira, and no one can find out about their "relationship".</h2>

        <h3>Iori Kitahara looks forward to his new life on the Izu Peninsula as he prepares to start his college life there, staying in a room above his uncle's diving shop "Grand Blue." However, he is quickly shocked as he meets the local Diving Club, a group full of buff men who spend more time drinking, partying, and stripping naked than actually diving. Despite his attempts to distance himself from the group, Iori gets quickly swept up in their antics, while his cousins try to show him the wonders of diving into the ocean and sea.</h3>
