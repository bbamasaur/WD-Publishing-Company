          <h5>When founding Kodansha, Seiji Noma believed that the role of new media was to educate people and develop society.
            His belief was that nothing in the world was too complicated to make into an entertaining piece, that it could overcome language barriers and be of benefit to all nations, and achieve world peace.
            
            Over a century after his journey began, Kodansha continues this dream with its library brimming with lively content. Read magazines and books, be industrious, and succeed—that was the message from Seiji Noma, and it inspired those who had talent but had missed the opportunity for higher education because of economic reasons. Seiji actively employed such young people. This was the expression and embodiment of the “Japanese Dream.”
